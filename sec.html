Huawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former engineer in the People's Liberation Army. At the time of its establishment, Huawei focused on manufacturing phone switches, but has since expanded its business to include building telecommunications networks, providing operational and consulting services and equipment to enterprises inside and outside of China, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market.[6][7] Huawei has over 170,000 employees as of September 2015, around 76,000 of whom are engaged in research and development (R&D).[8][9] It has 21 R&D institutes in countries including China, the United States,[10] Canada,[11] the United Kingdom,[12] Pakistan, Finland, France, Belgium, Germany, Colombia, Sweden, Ireland, India,[13] Russia, Israel, and Turkey,[14][15] and in 2014, the company invested $6.4 billion USD in R&D, up from $5 billion USD in 2013.[16]

In 2014, Huawei recorded a profit of 34.2 billion CNY (5.5 billion USD).[17] Its products and services have been deployed in more than 170 countries and it currently serves 45 of the world's 50 largest telecoms operators.[18]

In June 2016, Huawei is reportedly working on and designing its own mobile OS for future usage.[19]

<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p> Huawei is the official translation of the firm's Chinese name (simplified Chinese: 华为; traditional Chinese: 華為; pinyin: Huáwéi). The etymology of the character 华 is derived from "花" which means "flower." This is hinted at in Huawei's logo. The character can also mean "splendid" or "magnificent," but nowadays mostly refers to "China" or "(ethnic) Chinese" (see also Names of China). It is common for Chinese companies to use this word, another example being the Taiwanese company Asus (simplified Chinese: 华硕; traditional Chinese: 華碩; pinyin: Huáshuò; literally: "Chinese-Eminent") that was founded back in 1989. The second character of Huawei's name, 为, means "action" or "achievement," thus Huawei literally means "Chinese achievement."[27]

The correct way of pronouncing Huawei is "Hwa-Way". According to a Gizmodo video that erroneously claims to provide the "official pronunciation, [28] and other internet sources, it is pronounced "Wah-Way" . This is incorrect. Pronouncing it "Wah-Way" is an unfortunate perpetuation of a mistaken combination of the Cantonese and Mandarin pronunciations for the first and second characters, respectively. The Cantonese pronunciation is "Wah-Waii,"[29] while the Mandarin pronunciation is "Hwa-Way" (IPA: [ˈχwɑːˌweɪ]). The use of Huawei as the spelling for its name reflects the Mandarin pronunciation of the two characters.</p>

Huawei delivered one of the world’s first LTE/EPC commercial networks for TeliaSonera in Oslo, Norway in 2009. The company launched the world's first end-to-end 100G solution from routers to transmission system that same year, to help meet the rapid growth of network traffic and enhance router efficiency and reliability.[32]

In July 2010, Huawei was included in the Global Fortune 500 2010 list published by the U.S. magazine Fortune for the first time, on the strength of annual sales of US$21.8 billion and net profit of US$2.67 billion.[40] In late 2010 it was reported that Huawei is planning to invest around US$500 million (Rs 2,200 crore) to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India and $US100 million to expand its R&D center in Bangalore.[41][42]

In October 2012, it was announced that Huawei would move its UK headquarters to Green Park, Reading, Berkshire.[43] The company also, in an effort to increase its prominence in the United States, became the main sponsor of the Jonas Brothers' 2013 summer tour.[44]
